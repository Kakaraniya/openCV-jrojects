# Open CV
Welcome to the repository for various Python projects using OpenCV! This repository contains small projects to perform different tasks and image processing techniques implemented using the OpenCV library.

## Installation

To install open cv, open your terminal/command prompt and type:

```sh
pip install opencv-python
```
or:
```sh
pip3 install opencv-python
```
If that doesn't work then type:
```sh
python -m pip install opencv-python
```
or: 
```sh
python3 -m pip install opencv-python
```
Note that numpy automatically gets installed in your computer. Now below I've mentioned the key feature of each project.

**project 1:** When you run the python file, it opens up the image for you. Press any key to close the image.

**project 2:** It changes the color of pixels at the top to random colors and it copies few pixels of the image and pastes it at another part of the image.

**project 3:** It opens your webcam and shows shows your face 4 times in s frame two of which are rotated up-side-down. Press q to close the window. Note that if your webcam does not start, change the value of the argument inside VideoCapture() function.

**project 4:** I tried out how to draw various shapes and lines and write a string, in different colors, in the video.

**project 5:** It detects any object with blue color in your frame.

**project 6:** It detects the corners in your image.

**project 7:** It detects a particular object in your image.

**project 8:** It detects face and eyes present inside the frame of your webcam.
